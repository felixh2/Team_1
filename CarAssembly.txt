1) Car look: The car shall look like crap. This is the companies polocy to PR a 'we don't care' look to our cars, so our costumers know how dirty and not important they are. Because they are "hipsters"

2) The aerodynamic test was sucessful. The car flew away into the wall as expected.

4) Performed test drive. Someone died but that's ok... it was Ben

5) Test completed. The car moves. It was shipped to the warehouse. They would not accept it. As I quote: "The production level does not fit our professional visual standards. And we castrate cows. Literally.. blood everywere. Still... this would low our staffs moral when coming to work.
